# pyvision3
A computer vision library that complements OpenCV 3.x to add many extremely useful features for developers and scientists alike. Pyvision3 is intended to be a successor to Pyvision that takes advantage of OpenCV 3.x and Python 3.x features.

Pyvision3 is not designed to be backwards compatible to earlier versions of Python and OpenCV. For those developing with Python 2.7, I suggest continuing to use the original Pyvision code, which can be found on github.
